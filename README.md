# E-Commerce Back End

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-skyblue.svg)

## Description

Using prior framework code, backend code was written and implemented in order to allow for retrieval and manipulation of a database to be used for e-commerce. This was completed in order to build an understanding of sequelize associations and routing code using RESTful API and CRUD.

## Installation

In order to install the project, use 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies. PostgreSQL is used to set up the database and seeds so logging into psql and installing the schema.sql located in the db folder will be required. Afterwards, 'npm run seed' can be used to seed the database with all the test information.

## Usage

Since this is only backend code, a program to interact with the backend will be required(e.g. Insomnia). From there you may follow the proper routes for Get, Post, Put, and Delete that can be found within the code in the routes folder. The model files for the database found within the models folder can inform you of the different data points that will need to be included in the JSON sent to the backend for creating and updating.

## Contributing

How to contribute to this project:

This backend is mostly complete save for possibly making the routes and database more efficient.

## Tests

Tests were completed through Insomnia and recorded in the video posted in the links section of this README.
